# Automated Web Data Scraping
<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script automates the process of logging into a website and extracting data from dynamically generated web pages using Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup. The script navigates to a specified URL, inputs login credentials, and iterates through a defined date range to gather data from a particular section of the site. It waits for the page to load, scrapes the table data, and processes it into a structured pandas DataFrame. After cleaning the data, the script compiles all collected entries into a single DataFrame, which is then exported to an Excel file.
